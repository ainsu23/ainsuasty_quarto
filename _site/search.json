    "text": "This post is oriented to create classes that recreates data structures and explanaition for each. Knowing this may help you improve as a programmer because is the basic of each language you would work R, python, c, javascript, others..\nData structures to work with:\n\nArrays\nLinkedLists\nHashtable\nStacks\nQueues\nTrees\nGraphs\n\n\nArraysLinkedLists\n\n\nR manages dinamics vectors, this means that one index can be added to an existed vector. For the purpose of this blog I would create a class R6Class to simmulate an Array. Within this array, you would be able to get an index, push a new item at the end, pop last item, delete an index.\n\nmyarray <- R6::R6Class(\n  classname = \"myarray\",\n  public = list(\n    initialize = function() {\n      self$array_length <- 0\n      self$array_data <- c()\n    },\n    array_length = NULL,\n    array_data = NULL,\n    get_value = function(index) {\n      return(self$array_data[index])\n    },\n    push = function(value) {\n      self$array_data[self$array_length + 1] = value\n      self$array_length <- length(self$array_data)\n    },\n    pop = function() {\n      lastItem <- self$array_data[self$array_length]\n      self$array_data <- self$array_data[-self$array_length]\n      self$array_length <- length(self$array_data)\n      return(lastItem)\n    },\n    delete = function(index) {\n      self$array_data <- self$array_data[-index]\n      self$array_length <- length(self$array_data)\n    }\n  )\n)\nmyarray = myarray$new()\nmyarray$push(2)\nmyarray$pop()\n\n\n\nLinkedLists are a set of nodes (that contains information related to where the data is stored in pc memory (pointers) and which node is next or previous). Until my understanding, R does not have linkedList in its implementation, list are manage as vectors or arrays. There exists 2 types or linked lists, one is single which it has just one direction and double which has two directions.\nNevertheless, let’s implement an double linkedList with R6Class:\n\nmy_Linked_List <- R6::R6Class(\n  classname = \"linkedList\",\n  public = list(\n    # Initialize with the first value of the linkedList, .next would be NULL\n    initialize = function(value) {\n      self$list_pointer <- list(new.env())\n      self$list_pointer[[1]]$value <- value\n      self$index_head <- 1\n      self$index_tail <- 1\n      self$list_pointer[[1]]$index_next <- NULL\n      self$list_pointer[[1]]$index_prev <- NULL\n    },\n    list_pointer = NULL,\n    index_head = NULL,\n    index_tail = NULL,\n    # next is an used variable from R.\n    get_index = function(index) {\n      if (self$index_tail < index) stop(\"index not created yet!\")\n      return(self$list_pointer[[index]]$value)\n    },\n    insert = function(value) {\n      self$list_pointer <- self$list_pointer %>%\n        append(new.env())\n      self$index_tail <- self$index_tail + 1\n      self$list_pointer[[self$index_tail]]$index_prev <-\n        self$list_pointer[[self$index_tail - 1]]\n      self$list_pointer[[self$index_tail - 1]]$index_next <-\n        self$list_pointer[[self$index_tail]]\n      self$list_pointer[[self$index_tail]]$value <- value\n      self$list_pointer[[self$index_tail]]$index_next <- NULL\n      return(self$list_pointer)\n    }\n  )\n)"

    "text": "Interacting with firebase from R\nFirstly, you need to have all setup in firebase so R can connect trough API, we recommend to store the API_KEY, firebase_url and password in the .Renviron file in the root of the app (where ui.R and server.R are stored or app.R).\nSecondly, it is very important to be familiar with JSON structures in order to design how you are going to store your data in firebase.\nFrom previous, you might want to bring the information, update, delete, insert, among others. Let’s build together the select.\n\nDefine JSON structure to store data\nIn my learning polish app, I design to have a list of words, this list would contains a list of categories, and each of this would have the register with the word, translation in spanish and date of insertion in a simple text.\nFor the purpose of the blog I am going to use a fragment of data from my learning polish shiny app.\n\n{\n  \"words\" : {\n    \"animals\" : [\n        \"pies: perro: 2022-01-23\",\n        \"kot: gato: 2022-01-23\",\n        \"biedronka: mariquita: 2022-01-23\",\n        \"Ptak: Pájaro: 2022-01-23\",\n        \"Komar: Mosquito: 2022-01-23\", ],\n    \"clothes\" : [\n        \"buty: zapatos:2022-01-26\",\n        \"spodnie: pantalón: 2022-01-30\",\n        \"sweter: sueter: 2022-02-22\",\n        \"krawat: corbata: 2022-02-22\",\n        \"koszula: camisa: 2022-02-22\" ],\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nSelecting data from firebase\nThe firebase url given by google is the place where your data is stored. It will look somethis as followwing: “https://name-hash_given_firebase-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/”\nIf you would like to access to the words inside the category clothes, you might add the list words and clothes in the previous link, as follors:\n“https://name-hash_given_firebase-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/words/clothes”\nIn the documentary from firebase, you can find that you need to add .json when you are using an API (I invite you to read documentation to more detail).\n\nselect_words <- function(categories) {\n    words <- httr::content(\n      httr::GET(\n        paste0(\n          Sys.getenv(\"FIREBASE_URL\"), \"/words/\", categories, \".json\")\n      )\n    ) %>%\n    purrr::flatten() %>%\n    unlist()\n  return(words)\n}\n\n\nselect_categories <- function() {\n  categories <- content(GET(\n    paste0(Sys.getenv(\"FIREBASE_URL\"), \"/words/.json\")\n  ))\n  return(categories)\n}\n\n\n\nInsert data to firebase:\nFor inserting data you can use the function PUT from httr. Into words variable we bring the words from category so we can add the new word to already stored words and converted to json with jsonlite package.\n\nadd_words <- function(categories, word) {\n  if (word != \"\") {\n    words <- select_words(categories)\n    body <- jsonlite::toJSON(c(words, word),\n      pretty = TRUE\n    )\n    response <- httr::PUT(\n      paste0(Sys.getenv(\"FIREBASE_URL\"), \"/words/\", categories, \".json\"),\n      body = body\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nDelete data stored in firebase from R.\nThe following function receives the name of the category and one or more words (example: ptak and komar).\nThe first purrr::map compares each word with the list of words inside the category and save the position where it is stored in firebase.\nThe second purrr::map iterates over positions and tells firebase wich position to DELETE.\n\ndelete_words <- function(categories, word) {\n  words_delete <- purrr::map(\n    .x = stringr::str_to_lower(word),\n    .f = function(.x) {\n      content(GET(\n        paste0(Sys.getenv(\"FIREBASE_URL\"), \"/words/\", categories, \".json\")\n      )) %>%\n        stringi::stri_trans_tolower(.) %>%\n        unique() %>%\n        stringr::str_starts(.x) %>%\n        which() - 1\n    }\n  )\n  purrr::map(\n    .x = words_delete,\n    .f = function(.x) {\n      httr::DELETE(\n        paste0(\n          Sys.getenv(\"FIREBASE_URL\"), \"words/\", categories, \"/\", .x, \".json\"\n        )\n      )\n    }\n  )\n}\n\nThanks for reading.
